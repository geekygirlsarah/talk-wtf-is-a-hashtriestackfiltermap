# "WTF Is a HashTrieStackFilterMap?" A Data Structures and Algorithms Refresher for Everyone

## Abstract
- Are you about to go into job interviews where you'll be asked technical questions?
- Have you found you don't really know the standard data structures or algorithms, or you have holes in your knowledge?
- Has it been a long time since your computer science classes and you want a review session?

In this workshop, we'll go over all the basics of standard data structures and algorithms. We'll start at the beginning with different types of lists and build up from there. We'll also cover the basics of popular algorithms and how to analyze operations of the data structure to assess a “Big O” runtime. We'll break into teams to solve some technical problems. You will leave with a wealth of knowledge and resources to help you!

(While this won't replace a whole CS degree, it's designed to give you a boost in your CS learning journey.)
